Verb Trainer is a tool for practice conjugating French, Spanish, German, and eventually Japanese verb tenses. Its original purpose was to streamline the creation of notes for the Anki (http://ankisrs.net/) spaced-repetition software, but as I started creating it I realized it would also be useful for creating drills and exercises not specifically tied to Anki. This initial version handles the simple tenses for regular verbs for Spanish, French, and German. Compound tenses, irregular verbs, and stem- and spelling-changing verbs are not yet handled. Current development is focusing on exporting the conjugations to an Anki-compatible import format.

Invocation:
        python3 VerbTrainer.py

Future plans include:
- add support for compound tenses
- add support for irregular verbs, etc.
- develop Python ncurses front-end
- add integration with public domain sound files
- convert to an add-in for Anki and eliminate the need for an import file
- add Japanese support
- put all prompts into resource files so that different languages may be supported
